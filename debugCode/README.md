code has following parts:
performOperation() Function:
Retrieves numerical values entered by the user from HTML input fields (input1 and input2).
Validates that the entered values are valid numbers.

If both values are valid numbers, it calls the multiply() function passing these values, otherwise, it displays an error message.
multiply() Function:
Includes a debugger statement to pause code execution at this point for debugging purposes.
Multiplies two input numbers (a and b) and returns the result.
displayResult() Function:
Displays the result of the multiplication or an error message in a designated paragraph element (resultElement) on the webpage.

Practice task
You need to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, multiplication, and division simultaneously using the same function.

Additionally, you need to check the flow of the code, which will depend on the arithmetic operation you are performing first.

Also, try assigning one value in the form of characters and observe how this value is displayed using the debugger.
